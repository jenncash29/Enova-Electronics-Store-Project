# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Enova Electronics processed over 108,000 orders from 2019 to 2022, totaling approximately $28 million in sales with an average order value of $260. A significant portion of this growth is likely due to the surge in consumer spending during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in 2022, sales performance declined by 46% compared to 2021. By analyzing the data in depth, we aim to uncover trends and identify strategies to mitigate losses and explore new opportunities for growth.

# Insights Deep-Dive

### Sales Trends & Growth Rate Analysis

- **Overall Sales Trends**
  - Enova Electronics averaged around 27k sales per year from 2019 to 2022, generating approximately $7 million in revenue annually, with an average order value (AOV) of ~$254 USD. The year 2020 saw a dramatic increase in sales, with a 163% rise in total sales compared to 2019. This spike was followed by a gradual return to pre-pandemic sales levels seen in 2019, indicating a normalization of sales post-pandemic. However, Q4 of 2022 experienced a 45% decline in sales compared to Q4 of 2019, highlighting the ongoing impact on the market.

- **Growth Rates**
  - In terms of growth rates, 2020 was exceptional, with sales and revenue more than doubling compared to 2019. March 2020 marked a significant surge with a 50% increase in total sales and a 46% rise in order count, likely due to increased purchasing during the pandemic.

- **Seasonality**
  - Peak sales periods were consistently observed in November and December, coinciding with holiday seasons and Black Friday promotions. The highest sales and order count were recorded in December 2020. Additionally, September experienced a significant sales spike, likely driven by new Apple product releases and back-to-school shopping. In contrast, February and October were identified as the months with the lowest sales and order counts.

</p>

- **Product Performance**
  - The bulk of sales revenue comes from the top three products: the 27in 4K Gaming Monitor, Apple AirPods Headphones (the most popular product across all regions), and the MacBook Air Laptop. Together, these products account for 84.96% of total sales.
  - The ThinkPad Laptop and MacBook Air Laptop have the highest refund rates at 12% and 11%.  Despite the high refund rates, high-value items like the MacBook Air Laptop and ThinkPad Laptop significantly contribute to total sales due to their high average order values.
  - Products like the Samsung Charging Cable Pack and Samsung Webcam have low AOV but still contribute to total sales through high order volumes, although at a smaller percentage of total sales.
  - The Bose Soundsport Headphones overall contribution to sales is minimal.

</p>

- **Global Performance**
  - Out of 192 total countries, 13 countries contribute significantly to sales, accounting for approximately 82% of the total. These countries generate nearly $23 million out of the company's total sales of $28 million. A significant number of countries contribute minimally to the total sales, each accounting for less than 0.01% to 0.03% of total sales.
    - **Dominant Region NA (North America):** North America, particularly the United States, is the dominant market, contributing nearly half of the total sales.
    - **Strong EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, Africa) Presence:** The EMEA region also plays a significant role, with notable contributions from the UK, Germany, France, and Spain.
    - **APAC (Asia Pacific) Growth Potential:** APAC shows potential with strong sales in Japan and Australia, alongside emerging markets like India and South Korea.
    - **LATAM's (Latin America) Key Market:** Brazil leads in LATAM, with Mexico and other countries contributing to the regional sales.

### Loyalty Program Evaluation
- From 2019 to 2020, non-loyalty members outperformed loyalty members in terms of revenue, AOV, and order count. However, in 2021, loyalty members surpassed non-loyalty members in both sales and order count, marking a significant positive shift for the loyalty program. By 2022, loyalty members had outperformed non-loyalty members across all key metrics, demonstrating the growing success and impact of the loyalty program.
- Notably, in 2021, loyalty members made purchases significantly faster than non-loyalty members (48 days vs. 85 days). In 2022, loyalty members made purchases almost three times faster than non-loyalty members (38 days vs. 103 days).
- The data indicates a positive trend and growing effectiveness of the loyalty program, particularly evident in 2022.

</p>


- **Shipping Performance**
  - Days-to-Ship (1-3 days): Orders are evenly distributed across the first three days, with each day seeing around 36,000 orders. This indicates consistent and efficient shipping practices without significant delays or spikes. Both loyalty members and non-members have similar prompt shipping times.
  - Days-to-Deliver (2-9 days): The majority of orders are delivered within 4 to 7 days, with the peak delivery day being the 5th day (18,152 orders). Both loyalty members and non-members experience similar delivery patterns, with deliveries peaking between the 4th and 7th days.

### Refund Rate Analysis

- **Peak Refund Rates**
  - Refund rates peaked in 2020 at 9.22% across all products, marking a 61% increase over 2019. The ThinkPad Laptop had the highest refund rate at 11.76%, followed closely by the MacBook Air Laptop at 11.43%, with the MacBook having a slightly higher return count (453 vs. 343).
  
- **Most Returned Products**
  - The Apple AirPods Headphones were the most returned product with 2,636 units, followed by the 27in 4K Gaming Monitor with 1,445 units.
 
- **Average Days to Refund**
  - The analysis of our return policy indicates an average return time of 740 days, which is significantly higher than industry standards and customer expectations. It is unclear at this time if this is a result of an error in the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process or if this is a prolonged return policy.
  
- **Seasonality of Refunds**
  - The refund rates in February, March, and April are just slightly above the average. The difference is statistically insignificant and not a cause for immediate concern.

# Recommendations

Enova Electronics can address the decline in sales post-pandemic and position itself for sustainable growth in the future. 

<ins>**Sales Trends & Growth**</ins>  
- **Leverage Seasonal Promotions and Marketing Campaigns**
  - **Holiday Season Strategy (_November-December_):**
    - Increase marketing spend and promotional activities in the weeks leading up to November and December.
  - **Back-to-School and Apple Release Promotions (_August-September_):**
    - Back-to-School Campaigns: Promote products relevant to students and educators, such as laptops, tablets, and headphones, with back-to-school discounts and bundles. 
    - Product Launches and Promotions: Capitalize on new product launches, especially Apple products, by coordinating with Apple’s release schedule. Offer trade-in deals, special financing options, and discounts on accessories.
  - **Boost Low Sales Months (_February and October_):**
    - Targeted Sales Events: Introduce sales events specifically in February and October to drive customer interest. Consider themes like "Mid-Winter Clearance" or "Fall into Savings."
    - Customer Engagement: Increase engagement with loyalty program members during these months by offering exclusive member-only deals and early access to new products.
    - Email and Social Media Campaigns: Use targeted email campaigns and social media ads to remind customers of ongoing deals and new arrivals.
  - **Convert Non-Loyalty Members to Loyalty Members:**
    - Implement targeted marketing campaigns to convert non-loyalty members into loyalty members, thereby enhancing their lifetime value. By offering personalized incentives and highlighting the benefits of the loyalty program, such campaigns can encourage non-loyalty members to join and remain engaged, ultimately driving increased revenue and customer retention.

- **Product: Focus on High Performers & Explore Bundling Strategies**
  - Continue to prioritize marketing and inventory for top-selling items like the 27in 4K Gaming Monitor and Apple AirPods Headphones.
  - Consider bundling or promotions for products like the Samsung Charging Cable Pack or Samsung Webcam to boost their sales contribution without significantly impacting the overall refund rate.
  
- **Global: Focus on Major Markets**
  - Continue to strengthen presence and marketing in top-performing markets like the US, UK, and Japan.
  - Expand Emerging Markets: Leverage the growth potential in APAC and LATAM by investing in marketing and distribution channels in emerging markets like India and Brazil.

<ins>**Loyalty Program: Keep and Consider Enhancing with Incentives**</ins>
- Given the promising results from the most recent year, with loyalty members outperforming non-loyalty members in sales and demonstrating faster purchase times, it is recommended to keep and enhance the loyalty program with additional benefits. Strengthening the loyalty program could encourage more frequent purchases and potentially increase their order share.
- Consider offering incentives such as special expedited shipping options, early access to new products and sales, and personalized offers for loyalty program members.
  
<ins>**Refunds: Investigate the High Refund Rates and Prolonged Return Period**</ins>
- Investigate the high refund rates for the ThinkPad and MacBook Air laptops to understand and mitigate the underlying causes.
- Monitor seasonal refund rates during February through April ensuring they do not become larger issues.
- Address potential issues with errors in the ETL process to ensure accuracy of reporting refund data.  If no issues are found, implement a standard return window of 30 to 90 days from date of purchase.


# Assumptions and Caveats
There are areas in the dataset where data quality may need further investigation. While these issues did not significantly impact the quality of this analysis, they have been retained for completeness. It is recommended to consult with the data engineering team to determine if there were any ETL errors and address these values accordingly.

**Days to Refund:** There are 5,377 orders with an average return time of 740 days. This is likely an error in the ETL process. The orders were retained as they represent a very small portion of the dataset at approximately 5% and did not affect this specific analysis. However, this issue warrants further investigation and correction.  

**Zero USD Price Orders:** There are 158 orders with a listed price of USD 0. The reasons for these zero-priced orders are unclear—they could be due to special promotions, giveaways, or customer service issues. The orders were retained as it represents less than 1% of the data.

**Missing or Nonsensical Country Codes:** There are 206 orders with missing or nonsensical country codes. These entries may indicate data entry errors or issues during the data transformation process. The orders were retained as it represents less than 1% of the data.

# Next Steps
To enhance our data analysis and gain deeper insights, we can incorporate additional dimensions.  

**Customer Feedback:** Collect and analyze customer feedback, including product ratings and return reasons. This will help us understand customer preferences and pain points, enabling us to tailor more personalized and effective marketing strategies to improve product satisfaction and reduce return rates.  

**A/B Testing:** Implement A/B testing to evaluate the effectiveness of our various marketing campaigns, especially the seasonal campaigns. This approach will allow us to determine which strategies resonate best with our customers and optimize our marketing efforts accordingly.  

**Web Events Tracking:** Add a web_events table to monitor website traffic. By analyzing user behavior and sales funnels, we can identify areas for improvement in the customer journey and enhance the overall user experience on our site.
